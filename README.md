# Uni Links + NFC Support

This repository contains the Uni Links + NFC Support plugin platform interface, as well as platform specific implementations.

The main `uni_links_nfc_support` plugin source code and documantation can be found in the [uni_links_nfc_support](uni_links_nfc_support) directory.


## What is the difference from the existing uni_links plug-in?
In addition to the existing url_links plug-in, it is a plug-in created by referring to the NFC Support code created by [CathalT](https://github.com/CathalT/uni_links).  
Added App/Deep Links support via NFC tag from existing url_links plug-in.
